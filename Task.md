# Task listing and assignment for lab2

## Description

We need to do a Conways game of life, but modified. With a plot of how the powers of good and 
evil have a war against each other (or any other plot that comes to mind)

These will most probably will be the tasks:

1. Create the game plot and define the world rules (type of characters, rules for interation,
zones, rules for zones, etc). In other words create the concept
2. Provide a detailed analysis on the behaviour of the cells in all the zones compared 
to the others. This information have to be in a report with screenshots attached
3. Implement the logic of the game itself (the actual updating of the cells on the map)
4. Define the user interaction with the game (to pause and play the simulation on `space`, 
to edit the cells on the map (with`left click` to add goblins, `r-click` to add magicians)
5. Upload the game to itch.io

Task 1 and 2 can be done by 2 persons (Cristi and Dima).
Task 3-5 by other 3 (Ion, Gabi, Liviu)
